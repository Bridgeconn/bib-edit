              <div><span>25</span><span>God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the cattle according to their kinds, and all the creatures that creep along the ground according to their kinds. God saw that it was good.</span></div>
              <div><span>26</span><span>Then God said, "Let us make humankind in our image, after our likeness, so they may rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move on the earth."</span></div>
              <div><span>27</span><span>God created humankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them, male and female he created them.</span></div>
              <div><span>28</span><span>God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply! Fill the earth and subdue it! Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and every creature that moves on the ground."</span></div>
              <div><span>29</span><span>Then God said, "I now give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the entire earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.</span></div>
